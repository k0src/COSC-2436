Question 1:

Answer for both linked list and array implementation of a stack:
    a. What is the worst case time complexity of the `push()` function?
    b. What is the worst case time complexity of the `pop()` function?
    c. What is the worst case time and space complexity of reversing a stack?

Question 2:

Write a function that takes a string and returns a strinf. This function will remove all adjacent duplicates in a string.
- Input: "abbaca" Output: "ca"

Question 3:

Write a program to reverse a stack using recursion, without using loops.
